# distance-table
Python program that utilizes Dijsktra's SSSP/Prim's MST algorithm to calculate the shortest distance from Denver, CO. It also determines the shortest distances to 14 other cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and Dallas. 

The distance table was previously created by Sung Hee Nam, my Algorithms professor. This was to save time on manually inputting some of the distances between cities. 

There are no other contributors nor maintaining of this project.
